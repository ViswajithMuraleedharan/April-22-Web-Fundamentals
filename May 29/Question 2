Null, undefined and not declared are special outputs given in various special cases. ‘null’ is the output given when the value of the variable is ‘null’.
Example: let x=’null’;
‘undefined’ is the error output given when the variable is not assigned any value. Here the value is empty rather than “null”.
Example: let x=’’;
‘not-defined’ is the error output given when the variable is not defined.
Example: x=’10’;
