question 1
Difference between var, let and const?
Answer:-

var, let and const are scopes used to declare and assign variables. 
'var' is used to declare and assign a variable which is to be re-declared and re-initialized again as much as needed. ‘var’ can be redeclared and reinitialized continuously without showing an error.
Syntax: var<variable name>;
	<variable name>=value;
Example: var a;
	  a=10;
‘let’ is used to declare and assign a variable that is to be re-initialized but not re-declared. ‘let’ can only be declared once and re-declaration will show an error, while it can be re-initialized again continuously. 
Syntax: let<variable name>=value;
Example: let a=10;
‘const’ is used to declare and assign a variable that cannot be re-initialized or re-declared. ‘const’ can only be declared and initiated once and redeclaring and reinitializing it will show an error.
Syntax: const<variable name>=value;
Example: const a=10;
